        <strong>Rules and Regulations</strong><br />
        Football has specific rules governing gameplay, such as offside, fouls,
        and penalty kicks. Understanding these rules is essential for fair and
        competitive play. Offside is one of the confusing rules, that is nothing
        but the player is ahead of the defenders.
